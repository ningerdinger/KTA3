Key Topics in AI course OU: face recognition

1) You can run everything via the main.ipynb. It will call all the appropiate files accordingly. Everything will be explained in there. If you want to know indepth what is happening, feel free to browse the appropiate functions by ctrl + left click it. We tried to explain what each function is doing as appropiately as we can.

2) Word of warning, loading everything can take quite some time. Be prepared to have some coffee or do something else in meantime :)

Make sure to rename the videos accordingly after downloading. You can find how we called the videos in the second cell in main.ipynb
